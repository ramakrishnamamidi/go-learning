# ðŸš€ Learn Go (Golang)

Welcome to my Go learning repository!  
This repo contains weekly learning roadmaps, hands-on coding projects, and progress tracking as I master Go from fundamentals to building real-world applications.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Understand Go syntax, types, interfaces, concurrency, and tooling
- Build CI/CD-ready, production-grade Go applications
- Create real world projects (microservices, CLIs, network tools, automation)
- Gain strong mastery in Go modules, testing, and profiling
